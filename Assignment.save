Fall 2021
For each task, write your answers and findings in a README file together 
with any code.
1 REFLECTIONS
1.1 SHOOTING
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List 
the possible reasons for the man not dying.
1.2 ALIEN
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. 
Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a 
clear step-by- step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you 
can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise)
2 TWO KATAS
Complete the following two katas using TDD. Make sure to follow the TDD 
mantra,
“red-green-refactor”:
• Red: Write a failing test.
• Green: Write the smallest implementation to make your test pass.
• Refactor: Make the necessary refactoring to the implementation and 
tests, in order to remove code redundancy
A fuller explanation of the TDD steps can be found here:

Remember, the point of these katas is not to solve the coding tasks as 
such. The point is to use TDD. Thus, if your code contains a solution to 
the task, but no tests, the solution is not accepted.
2.1 FAHRENHEIT-TO-CELCIUS CONVERTER
Use TDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter.
Use TDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter.
2.2 ROMAN NUMERAL KATA
Implement an “Arabic numeral to roman numeral” converter using TDD. Follow 
the standard form of roman numerals – the rules can be found on the 
wikipedia page: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Standard_form.
You can test your converter against this online converter:

3 GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TDD
Write your notes (in a readme file) regarding the TDD process, reflecting 
on the
following questions.
• What was positive and good about using TDD?
• What was annoying or difficult?
• What surprised you?
• Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought 
of?
4 HAND-IN
Individually, on Peergrade before the deadline. The hand-in should be a 
link to a repository including a section in README.md named Assignment 1 
with answers to the exercise questions.
