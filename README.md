## 1.1 SHOOTING
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List 
the possible reasons for the man not dying.

Missed Shot: The woman may have missed her target, shooting wide of the man or hitting a non-lethal area of his body.

Bullet Type: If the woman used non-lethal or low-caliber ammunition, it might not have been powerful enough to cause a fatal wound.

Distance: The distance between the woman and the man could have been significant, reducing the impact of the shot and making it less likely to cause a fatal injury.

Obstructions: There may have been objects or barriers between the woman and the man that altered the trajectory of the bullet, reducing its lethality.

Medical Intervention: Prompt medical attention and treatment can save lives in many gunshot cases. If the man received immediate medical care, he could have survived the gunshot wound.

Body Armor: The man could have been wearing body armor, which is designed to protect against gunfire.

Luck: In some cases, individuals have survived gunshot wounds due to factors like the angle of the shot, the path of the bullet, and pure luck.

Superficial Wound: The bullet might have caused a superficial or non-life-threatening injury, such as grazing the skin or causing a flesh wound.

Bullet Fragmentation: The bullet might have fragmented upon impact, causing less severe injuries.



## 1.2 ALIEN
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. 
Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a 
clear step-by- step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you 
can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise)

Materials Needed:

Toothbrush
Toothpaste
Clean, drinkable water

Prepare the Toothbrush:

Pick up the toothbrush with your dominant hand. (If you're not sure which is your dominant hand, use the one you feel most comfortable with.)
Hold the toothbrush by its handle, ensuring a firm grip.
Apply Toothpaste:

Squeeze a pea-sized amount of toothpaste onto the bristles of the toothbrush. This is typically enough for effective cleaning.
Wet the Toothbrush:

Turn on the faucet or use a cup of clean, drinkable water to moisten the bristles of the toothbrush. This helps activate the toothpaste and prevents abrasive brushing.
Brush Your Teeth:

Place the toothbrush in your mouth and gently position the bristles against your teeth and gums.
Start with the upper teeth. Brush the outer surfaces by moving the brush in a circular or back-and-forth motion.
Move to the inner surfaces of the upper teeth and brush them as well.
Don't forget to brush the chewing surfaces of the upper teeth using a scrubbing motion.
Repeat the same steps for the lower teeth, both outer and inner surfaces, and chewing surfaces.
Brush Your Tongue and Roof of Mouth (Optional):

If you'd like to freshen your breath further, you can gently brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth.
Spit Out Excess Toothpaste and Saliva:

After brushing for about two minutes, spit out the toothpaste and saliva into the sink.
Rinse Your Mouth and Toothbrush:

Rinse your mouth thoroughly with water to remove any remaining toothpaste.
Rinse the toothbrush under running water to clean off any toothpaste residue.
Clean Your Toothbrush:

Shake off excess water from the toothbrush.
Store it in an upright position in a holder or cup, so it can air dry between uses.
Rinse the Sink



## 3 GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TDD

Positive Aspects of TDD:
1. Improved Code Quality:
TDD encourages writing tests before writing code. This practice ensures that the codebase is well-tested and reliable. It reduces the chances of introducing bugs and promotes clean, maintainable code.

2. Faster Debugging:
With comprehensive test suites in place, debugging becomes more efficient. When a test fails, it's easier to pinpoint the issue, making the debugging process faster and more straightforward.

3. Greater Confidence:
TDD provides a safety net. Developers can make changes or refactor code with confidence, knowing that if they inadvertently break something, the tests will catch it. This leads to increased confidence in the codebase's stability.

4. Documentation:
Tests serve as living documentation for the codebase. They describe how the code should behave, making it easier for other developers to understand and work with the code.

5. Incremental Development:
TDD promotes a step-by-step approach to development. You start with a failing test, then implement the minimum code required to make the test pass. This incremental process helps in breaking down complex problems into manageable parts.

Challenging/the difficult Aspects of TDD:
1. Initial Learning Curve:
For developers new to TDD, there can be a learning curve. Writing effective tests and designing code with testability in mind can be challenging initially.

2. Time-Consuming:
Writing tests before the code can be time-consuming, especially for complex features. Some developers may feel pressure to skip tests to save time, but this defeats the purpose of TDD.

3. Maintenance:
Maintaining a growing suite of tests can become challenging over time. Refactoring or making significant changes to the code may require updates to many tests, which can be cumbersome.

4. Test Fixture Setup:
Setting up complex test fixtures can sometimes be more challenging than writing the code itself, particularly when dealing with external dependencies.

Surprises with TDD:
1. Better Code Design:
TDD often leads to improved code design. Writing tests first forces developers to think critically about the interface and structure of their code. This can lead to more elegant and modular solutions.

2. Increased Productivity:
Contrary to the expectation that TDD might slow down development, it can actually lead to increased productivity in the long run. Fewer bugs and faster debugging save time during the later stages of development.
